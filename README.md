### Elevator Pitch
My webiste will be a site where users can login to rate and review any form of common media, like movies, TV shows, books, and video games. Users can simply leave a 0-5 star rating, or can leave a full review of the chosen media. Users will be able to see other users reviews, as well as see their history of past reviews and ratings on the users profile page. Using public APIs, when a user serches for media, it will pull the thumbnail, description, and other relevant info, syncing the review with the media, allowing all users to leave reviews on the same media
