Midterm Questions
* In the following code, what does the link element do? 
* In the following code, what does a div tag do?
* In the following code, what is the difference between the #title and .grid selector? **a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (".") and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character ("#"). The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one**
* In the following code, what is the difference between padding and margin? **The biggest difference between padding and margin is that vertical margins auto-collapse, and padding doesn't. Consider two elements one above the other each with padding of 1em. This padding is considered to be part of the element and is always preserved.You will end up with the content of the first element, followed by the padding of the first element, followed by the padding of the second, followed by the content of the second element. Thus the content of the two elements will end up being 2em apart.Now replace that padding with 1em margin. Margins are considered to be outside of the element, and margins of adjacent items will overlap.** 
* Given this HTML and this CSS how will the images be displayed using flex?
* What does the following padding CSS do?
* What does the following code using arrow syntax function declaration do? **Without Arrow: hello = function() {return "Hello World!";} || hello = () => {return "Hello World!";} || If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the return keyword: hello = () => "Hello World!";**
* What does the following code using map with an array output?
* What does the following code output using getElementByID and addEventListener? **The built-in method addEventListener() allows you to attach an event listener to an HTML element. It accepts two parameters: the event type to listen to and the callback function to run when the event is triggered: Element.addEventListener(type, callbackFn);**

  background-color: red;
}**
* How would you display an image with a hyperlink in HTML? **<a href="https://example.com">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
</a>**
* In the CSS box model, what is the ordering of the box layers starting at the inside and working out?
    **Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
    Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
    Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
    Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent** 
* Given the following HTML, what CSS would you use to set the text "trouble" to green and leave the "double" text unaffected?
* What will the following code output when executed using a for loop and console.log?
* How would you use JavaScript to select an element with the id of “byu” and change the text color of that element to green? **//Get the element with the ID "byu"

* Which of the following correctly describes JSON? **JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It's based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language, but it's language-independent and can be used by any programming language.**
* What does the console command chmod, pwd, cd, ls, vim, nano, mkdir, mv, rm, man, ssh, ps, wget, sudo  do?
chmod: Changes the permissions of a file or directory. This determines who can read, write, or execute a file.

Port 80: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
Port 22: SSH (Secure Shell)**
* What will the following code using Promises output when executed?
  





# Final Study Guide
* What is the default port for HTTP/HTTPS/SSH? **SSH = 22, Http = 80, Https = 443**
* What does an HTTP status code in the range of 300/400/500 indicate? **300 = redirection message, 400 = client error response, 500 = server error response**
* What does the HTTP header content-type allow you to do? **The HTTP Content-Type representation header is used to indicate the original media type of a resource before any content encoding is applied. In responses, the Content-Type header informs the client about the media type of the returned data. In requests such as POST or PUT, the client uses the Content-Type header to specify the type of content being sent to the server. If a server implementation or configuration is strict about content type handling, a 415 client error response may be returned.**
* What does a “Secure cookie”/”Http-only cookie”/”Same-site cookie” do? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies **1.The user sends sign-in credentials to the server, for example via a form submission. 2.If the credentials are correct, the server updates the UI to indicate that the user is signed in, and responds with a cookie containing a session ID that records their sign-in status on the browser. 3.At a later time, the user moves to a different page on the same site. The browser sends the cookie containing the session ID along with the corresponding request to indicate that it still thinks the user is signed in. 4.The server checks the session ID and, if it is still valid, sends the user a personalized version of the new page. If it is not valid, the session ID is deleted and the user is shown a generic version of the page (or perhaps shown an "access denied" message and asked to sign in again).**
* Assuming the following Express middleware, what would be the console.log output for an HTTP GET request with a URL path of /api/document?
* Given the following Express service code: What does the following front end JavaScript that performs a fetch return?
* Given the following MongoDB query, select all of the matching documents {name:Mark}
* How should user passwords be stored? **Hashed**
* Assuming the following node.js websocket code in the back end, and the following front end websocket code, what will the front end log to the console?
* What is the websocket protocol intended to provide? **Realtime updates. WebSocket is a bidirectional communication protocol that can send the data from the client to the server or from the server to the client by reusing the established connection channel**
* What do the following acronyms stand for? JSX, JS, AWS, NPM, NVM **JavaScript XML, JavaScript, Amazon Web Services, Nope Package Manager, Node Version Manager**
* Assuming an HTML document with a body element. What text content will the following React component generate?  The react component will use parameters.
* Given a set of React components that include each other, what will be generated
* What does a React component with React.useState do? **The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component, and change it based on certian criteria**
* What are React Hooks used for? **Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods. for example, useState is a hook** 
* What does the State Hook/Context Hook/Ref Hook/Effect Hook/Performance Hook do? https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks
  * **State Hook - State lets a component “remember” information like user input. For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index. useState declares a state variable that you can update directly.**
  * **Ref Hook -Refs let a component hold some information that isn’t used for rendering, like a DOM node or a timeout ID. Unlike with state, updating a ref does not re-render your component. Refs are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. They are useful when you need to work with non-React systems, such as the built-in browser APIs. useRef declares a ref. You can hold any value in it, but most often it’s used to hold a DOM node.** 
  * **Effect Hook -Effects let a component connect to and synchronize with external systems. This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code. useEffect connects a component to an external system.**
  * **Performance Hook - A common way to optimize re-rendering performance is to skip unnecessary work. For example, you can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data has not changed since the previous render. To skip calculations and unnecessary re-rendering, use one of these Hooks: useMemo lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation. useCallback lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.**  
* Given React Router code, select statements that are true.
* What does the package.json file do? **the package.json file serves as a central hub for managing dependencies, scripts, metadata, and other essential project information. It is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file located at the root directory of a NodeJS project, providing vital configuration details and facilitating seamless project management.**
* What does the fetch function do? **The fetch() method in JavaScript is a modern and powerful way to retrieve resources from a server. It returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object, encapsulating the server’s response to your request.**
* What does node.js do?
* What does pm2 do?
* What does Vite do?
